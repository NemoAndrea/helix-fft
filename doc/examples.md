# Example helices

Below are some example `helix-families` (a collection of helices that make up a structure) that you can open directly in `helix-FFT`.

### B-DNA - [open model](https://nemoandrea.github.io/helixiser/#name=B-DNA&radius=1&rise=0.34&frequency=10&unit_size=0.18&radius=1&rise=0.34&frequency=10&unit_size=0.18&rotation=143)

*The default example in `helix-FFT`, the diffraction pattern of the `double` helix features the characteristic missing layer-line (@ n=3) as observed experimentally in Rosalind Franklin's famous 'Photo 51'*



### F-Actin - [open model](https://nemoandrea.github.io/helixiser/#name=F-actin&radius=2.5&rise=2.75&frequency=2.166&unit_size=3&offset=0&rotation=0&handedness=right)

*A ubiquitous helical filament in cells, F-actin is a `single` helix that can, due to the large angle between subunits, be seen as two slowly turning helices. **This model should be viewed with `n=6`, `m=3`***

### Microtubule (13 Protofilaments) - [open model](https://nemoandrea.github.io/helixiser/#name=Microtubule_13PF&radius=12.5&rise=0.946&frequency=13&unit_size=2.5&offset=0&handedness=right&radius=12.5&rise=0.946&frequency=13&unit_size=2.5&offset=4.1&handedness=right&radius=12.5&rise=0.946&frequency=13&unit_size=2.5&offset=8.2&handedness=right)

*Another common helical filament in cells, Microtubules are not quite helical, but are close enough for the analytic solution to reproduce experimental data. Microtubules of this variety can be seen as three-start helices (i.e. three helices).* **This model should be viewed with `n=13` and `m=1`**
